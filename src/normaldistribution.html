            <p class="leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-4">
                It is often the case with medical data that the histogram of a continuous variable obtained from a single measurement on different subjects will have a characteristic "bell-shaped" distribution known as a Normal distribution.
                One such example is the histogram of the birth weight (in kilograms) of the 3,226 newborn babies shown in Figure 1.

                The histogram of the sample data is an estimate of the population distribution of birth weights in newborn babies. This population distribution can be estimated by the superimposed smooth "bell-shaped" curve or Normal distribution shown.
                We presume that if we were able to look at the entire population of newborn babies, the distribution of birth weight would have exactly the Normal shape.

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-700 mb-4">Parameters of the Normal Distribution</h2>
            <p class="leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-4">
                The Normal distribution is completely described by two parameters μ and σ, where μ represents the population mean, or center of the distribution, and σ the population standard deviation.
                It is symmetrically distributed around the mean. Populations with small values of the standard deviation σ have a distribution concentrated close to the center μ; those with large standard deviation have a distribution widely spread along the measurement axis.
            </p>
            <p class="leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-4">
                One mathematical property of the Normal distribution is that exactly 95% of the distribution lies between μ − (1.96 × σ) and μ + (1.96 × σ). Changing the multiplier 1.96 to 2.58, exactly 99% of the Normal distribution lies in the corresponding interval.

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-700 mb-4">Estimation from Sample Data</h2>
            <p class="leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-4">
                In practice, the two parameters of the Normal distribution, μ and σ, must be estimated from the sample data. For this purpose, a random sample from the population is first taken. 
                The sample mean and the sample standard deviation are then calculated. If a sample is taken from such a normal distribution, and provided the sample is not too small, 
                then approximately 95% of the sample lies within the interval: x̄ − [1.96 × SD(x̄)] to x̄ + [1.96 × SD(x̄)].

        <!-- Section 4: Example of Reference Range -->
        <section class="bg-white p-8 rounded-lg shadow-md mb-6">
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-700 mb-4">Example of Reference Range</h2>
            <p class="leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-4">
                We can use the fact that our sample birth weight data appear Normally distributed to calculate a reference range. 
                About 95% of the observations (from a Normal distribution) lie within ±1.96 SDs of the mean. So a reference range for our sample of babies, using the values given in the histogram above, is:
                3.39 kg − [1.96 × 0.55] to 3.39 kg + [1.96 × 0.55], which results in a range of 2.31 kg to 4.47 kg.
