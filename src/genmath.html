            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">An annuity is a continuous stream of equal periodic payments from one party to another for a specified period of time to fulfill a financial obligation. Understanding annuities requires recognizing key characteristics such as regular payments, timing, and frequency.</p>

                <li><span class="font-semibold">Frequency:</span> Payment and interest rate compounding frequencies may align or differ.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mt-4">Unlike single payments, solving series of payments requires selecting the correct formula based on the financial characteristics.</p>

            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Annuities are classified based on the timing of payments and frequency of interest compounding. Below are the four types of annuities:</p>

            <h2 class="text-xl text-gray-800 font-bold">Summary</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Annuities must satisfy four characteristics: continuity, equal payment amounts, periodicity, and a specified time frame. If any characteristic is violated, it is not an annuity and requires different financial methods for calculations.</p>
