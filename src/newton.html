      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-700">Introduction</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-2">
        Newton’s laws of motion describe the relationship between the forces acting on a body and its motion due to those forces. For example, if your car breaks down and you need to push it, you must exert a force with your hands on the car for it to move. These laws explain how the car will move based on the force you apply.

    <!-- Section 2: First Law -->
    <section class="mb-6">
        <article class="bg-gray-50 p-4 rounded-lg shadow-md mb-4">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-700">First Law: Law of Inertia</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-2">
        Newton’s first law states that if an object experiences no net force, its velocity remains constant: the object is either at rest (if its velocity is zero), or it moves in a straight line with constant speed (if its velocity is nonzero). For example, if you don’t push the car (no force), it doesn’t move.

    <!-- Section 3: Second Law -->
    <section class="mb-6">
        <article class="bg-gray-50 p-4 rounded-lg shadow-md mb-4">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-700">Second Law: Force and Acceleration</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-2">
        The second law states that the acceleration of an object is parallel and directly proportional to the net force acting on it, and inversely proportional to its mass. For example, if you push a car with a greater force, it will accelerate more. But if the car is more massive, it will not accelerate as much from the same force.

    <!-- Section 4: Third Law -->
    <section class="mb-6">
        <article class="bg-gray-50 p-4 rounded-lg shadow-md mb-4">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-700">Third Law: Action and Reaction</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-2">
        Newton’s third law states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. For example, when you push a car, it pushes back with an equal force. The force you exert on the car is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the force the car exerts on you.

    <!-- Section 5: Examples of Force -->
    <section class="mb-6">
        <article class="bg-gray-50 p-4 rounded-lg shadow-md mb-4">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-700">Examples of Force</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-2">
        In physics, a force is any influence that causes an object to undergo a change in motion, direction, or shape. For example, a push or pull can change an object's velocity. Forces can also cause deformation in flexible objects or fluids.

    <!-- Section 6: Mass -->
    <section class="mb-6">
        <article class="bg-gray-50 p-4 rounded-lg shadow-md mb-4">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-700">Mass</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-2">
        Mass is a measure of an object’s resistance to acceleration. It is often confused with weight, but they are different. Mass is an intrinsic property that never changes, whereas weight is the force due to gravity acting on an object.

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-700">Newton’s Laws in Action</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-2">
        The laws of motion are observed in daily life, from a swimmer pushing off the wall to a rocket launching into space. For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction, whether it is a car accelerating or a rocket expelling gas to lift off.
