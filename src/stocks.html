            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Corporations may raise money for their expansion by issuing stocks. Stocks represent shares in the ownership of the company. There are two types of stocks:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mb-4">
                <li><strong>Common Stock</strong> - Represents basic ownership in a company.</li>
                <li><strong>Preferred Stock</strong> - Gives holders priority over common stockholders in receiving dividends.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Both types of stockholders receive dividends (a share of earnings). However, dividends are paid first to preferred shareholders. Stocks can be bought or sold at their current price, called the market value. Upon purchasing shares, the investor receives a certificate with details such as the corporation name, owner's name, number of shares, and par value per share.</p>

            <h2 class="text-gray-800 font-bold text-2xl mb-4">Bonds</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Bonds are interest-bearing securities that promise to pay a certain amount of money at a specified maturity date as outlined in the bond certificate. Bondholders are lenders to the issuing institution, which could be a government or a private company.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Unlike stockholders, bondholders do not have voting rights at annual meetings, but they are first in line to claim the institutional earnings. At maturity, bondholders receive the face value of the bond along with coupon payments (interest), which are typically made semi-annually, depending on the coupon rate stated in the bond certificate.</p>
