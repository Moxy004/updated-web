            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Motion is one of the most common phenomena we encounter in our daily lives. For example, a moving car, a kid running on the road, or a fly moving in the air are all in motion. So, in general terms, a body is said to be in motion if it changes its position with respect to a reference point and time. Depending upon the path taken by the particle, the motion can be of different types like projectile motion, rectilinear motion, rotational motion, etc. We will only focus on the rectilinear motion, which is also known as linear motion.

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                When we require only one co-ordinate axis and time to describe a particle’s motion, it is said to be in linear motion or rectilinear motion. Examples of linear motion are a parade of soldiers, a train moving along a straight line, and many more.

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                So now that we have learned about linear motion, we will discuss two terms related to change in position. These are called – ‘Distance and Displacement’.
                Distance is defined as the total path length covered during a journey. While displacement is defined as the path length from final position of the particle to the origin O.

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-700 mb-2">Speed and Velocity</h3>
            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                These terms are used to describe the rate of change of position. Speed is the rate of change in distance, while velocity is the rate of change in displacement. Comparing from above as distance can never be negative, so the speed is never negative while velocity can be positive and negative.
