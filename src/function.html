            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">A function is defined as a relation between a set of inputs having one output each. In simple words, a function is a relationship between inputs where each input is related to exactly one output. Every function has a domain and codomain or range. A function is generally denoted by f(x) where x is the input. The general representation of a function is y = f(x).</p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl text-blue-700 font-bold">What is a Function in Maths?</h2>
                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">In mathematics, an expression, rule, or law that defines a relationship between one variable (the independent variable) and another variable (the dependent variable). Functions are ubiquitous in mathematics and are essential for formulating physical relationships in the sciences. The modern definition of function was first given in 1837 by the German mathematician Peter Dirichlet:</p>
                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">This relationship is commonly symbolized as y = f(x)—which is said “f of x”—and y and x are related such that for every x, there is a unique value of y. That is, f(x) can not have more than one value for the same x. To use the language of set theory, a function relates an element x to an element f(x) in another set. The set of values of x is called the domain of the function, and the set of values of f(x) generated by the values in the domain is called the range of the function. In addition to f(x), other abbreviated symbols such as g(x) and P(x) are often used to represent functions of the independent variable x, especially when the nature of the function is unknown or unspecified.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl text-blue-700 font-bold">Common Functions</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Many widely used mathematical formulas are expressions of known functions. For example, the formula for the area of a circle, A = πr², gives the dependent variable A (the area) as a function of the independent variable r (the radius). Functions involving more than two variables (called multivariable or multivariate functions) also are common in mathematics, as can be seen in the formula for the area of a triangle, A = bh/2, which defines A as a function of both b (base) and h (height). In these examples, physical constraints force the independent variables to be positive numbers. When the independent variables are also allowed to take on negative values—thus, any real number—the functions are known as real-valued functions.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl text-blue-700 font-bold">Polynomial Functions</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">The formula for the area of a circle is an example of a polynomial function. The general form for such functions is P(x) = a₀ + a₁x + a₂x² + ⋯ + anxn, where the coefficients (a₀, a₁, a₂,…, an) are given, x can be any real number, and all the powers of x are counting numbers (1, 2, 3,…). Polynomial functions have been studied since the earliest times because of their versatility—practically any relationship involving real numbers can be closely approximated by a polynomial function. Polynomial functions are characterized by the highest power of the independent variable. Special names are commonly used for such powers from one to five—linear, quadratic, cubic, quartic, and quintic for the highest powers being 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, respectively.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl text-blue-700 font-bold">Graphs of Functions</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">The independent variable x is plotted along the x-axis (a horizontal line), and the dependent variable y is plotted along the y-axis (a vertical line). When the graph of a relation between x and y is plotted in the x-y plane, the relation is a function if a vertical line always passes through only one point of the graphed curve; that is, there would be only one point f(x) corresponding to each x, which is the definition of a function.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">For example, the graph of the cubic equation f(x) = x³ − 3x + 2 is shown in the figure.</p>

            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Note that each of these functions is periodic. Thus, the sine and cosine functions repeat every 2π, and the tangent and cotangent functions repeat every π.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Another common type of function that has been studied since antiquity is the trigonometric functions, such as sin x and cos x, where x is the measure of an angle. Because of their periodic nature, trigonometric functions are often used to model behavior that repeats, or “cycles.”</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl text-blue-700 font-bold">Exponential Functions</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">The exponential function is a relation of the form y = ax, with the independent variable x ranging over the entire real number line as the exponent of a positive number a. Probably the most important of the exponential functions is y = ex, sometimes written y = exp(x), in which e (2.7182818…) is the base of the natural system of logarithms (ln). By definition x is a logarithm, and there is thus a logarithmic function that is the inverse of the exponential function. Specifically, if y = ex, then x = ln y. Nonalgebraic functions, such as exponential and trigonometric functions, are also known as transcendental functions.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl text-blue-700 font-bold">Complex Functions</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">A point in the complex plane. Unlike real numbers, which can be located by a single signed (positive or negative) number along a number line, complex numbers require a plane with two axes, one axis for the real number component and one axis for the imaginary component. Although the complex plane looks like the ordinary two-dimensional plane, where each point is determined by an ordered pair of real numbers (x, y), the point x + iy is a single number.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Practical applications of functions whose variables are complex numbers are not so easy to illustrate, but they are nevertheless very extensive. They occur, for example, in electrical engineering and aerodynamics.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl text-blue-700 font-bold">Inverse Functions</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">By interchanging the roles of the independent and dependent variables in a given function, one can obtain an inverse function. Inverse functions do what their name implies: they undo the action of a function to return a variable to its original state. Thus, if for a given function f(x) there exists a function g(x) such that g(f(x)) = x, then g(x) is the inverse of f(x), and it is usually written f⁻¹(x).</p>

            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">In conclusion, functions are fundamental in understanding mathematical relationships and operations. They are not only critical in the study of pure mathematics but also have practical applications in fields like physics, engineering, and computer science. Functions allow us to model real-world phenomena, and their properties give insights into their behavior under different conditions.</p>
